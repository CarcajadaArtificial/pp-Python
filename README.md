# Personal Process Template - Python
Hello, my name is **Oscar** and I'm glad you've decided to use my Python template. See, I also had a tough time organizing my code's modules when I was starting. Often started to create code templates for my projects so that I didn't have to start from scratch. After adding tons of imports, packages, libraries and frameworks to different projects that used different programming languages or IDEs, I started to notice that I can manage my projects with a personal standard organization. This way I can collect information about my own projects and further improve my skills in an engineering manner.

## TL;DR
Basically, this is a coding template from myself and to myself but I'm glad to share the love. Have fun with Python!
